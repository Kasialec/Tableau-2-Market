# Tableau-2-Market
In this project, I analyzed customer purchase behavior for 2Market, a global supermarket, focusing on key areas such as customer demographics, advertising effectiveness, and product sales.
I utilized Excel and SQL to clean and analyze the dataset, identifying trends in customer demographics and purchase patterns. Key metrics such as average revenue from each marketing channel were calculated.
Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard (saved as a TWBX file) to visually communicate insights. The dashboard includes metrics on customer demographics, performance of advertising channels, and sales data for various products.
